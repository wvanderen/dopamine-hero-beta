# Dopamine Hero Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Transform productivity from a chore into an engaging musical journey through a hybrid incremental game and productivity tool
- Create sustainable motivation for adults with ADHD through sophisticated synth module mechanics and variable reward systems
- Deliver a dual-mode architecture that bridges Focus Mode (distraction-free work) and Game Mode (engaging synth assembly)
- Establish genuine utility rather than superficial gamification by making game mechanics meaningful to productivity optimization
- Build a premium ADHD-focused productivity solution that serves the underserved market of 15-20 million English-speaking adults

### Background Context

Dopamine Hero addresses the critical gap in ADHD-focused productivity solutions by combining sophisticated game mechanics with practical task management functionality. Unlike traditional tools that rely on willpower or simple reward systems, the application leverages variable reward systems and creative expression to work with neurodivergent brain chemistry rather than against it. The revolutionary synth module system replaces conventional gamification with creative assembly mechanics, allowing users to earn modules through completed focus sessions and combine them into personalized productivity "soundscapes" that represent their unique working style.

The solution targets the urgent need created by rising ADHD diagnosis rates (20%+ post-pandemic) and remote work demands for self-motivation. Current productivity solutions fail ADHD users through two inadequate approaches: basic focus tools lacking sustained engagement, or complex systems requiring executive function to implement. Dopamine Hero's neurodivergent-first design specifically addresses executive function challenges through immediate feedback loops, dual-currency economic systems connecting work types to gameplay, and preset management that reduces decision fatigue.

### Dual-Currency Economic Loop Design

**Core Economic Principle**: Dopamine Hero implements a sophisticated dual-currency system that creates a sustainable economic loop connecting productive focus work to enhanced gameplay capabilities, mirroring real-world ADHD motivation patterns where external rewards amplify internal drive.

**Energy Currency (Primary Currency)**:
- **Source**: Generated through completed focus sessions and task completion
- **Function**: Spent to acquire synth modules (the "raw materials" of gameplay)
- **Generation Rate**: Based on session duration, task complexity, and consistency factors
- **Visual Representation**: Golden/orange energy with pulsing animations indicating availability
- **Storage**: Limited capacity with overflow mechanics to encourage strategic spending

**Dopamine Currency (Secondary Enhancement Currency)**:
- **Source**: Generated by active module configurations during focus sessions
- **Function**: Enhances focus capabilities, boosts energy generation, and unlocks advanced modules
- **Generation Rate**: Determined by module configuration efficiency and synergy bonuses
- **Visual Representation**: Purple/pink crystalline structures with glow effects
- **Storage**: Unlimited accumulation with diminishing returns to encourage usage

**Economic Loop Flow**:
1. **Focus Work** → Generate **Energy** (based on task completion)
2. **Energy Spending** → Acquire **Modules** (synth components)
3. **Module Assembly** → Create **Configurations** (productivity soundscapes)
4. **Active Configurations** → Generate **Dopamine** (during focus work)
5. **Dopamine Enhancement** → Boost **Energy Generation** (accelerated earning)
6. **Enhanced Earning** → Acquire **Advanced Modules** (progressive unlock)

**Key Economic Mechanics**:
- **Synergy Bonuses**: Certain module combinations generate bonus dopamine
- **Focus Multipliers**: Dopamine can be spent to temporarily boost energy generation rates
- **Module Upgrades**: Dopamine enhances module effectiveness and unlocks new abilities
- **Economic Balance**: Energy gates progression while dopamine enables optimization and experimentation
- **Sustainable Loop**: The system rewards consistent focus while encouraging creative module experimentation

This dual-currency design creates meaningful economic decisions where users must balance between acquiring new modules (energy spending) and enhancing existing configurations (dopamine investment), ensuring long-term engagement through strategic resource management.

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

The application shall meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards with specific accommodations for neurodivergent users including reduced motion options, high contrast themes, ADHD-friendly focus modes, and screen reader compatibility for all interactive elements.

### Branding

The visual design should evoke early electronic music studios and modular synthesizers, with a modern twist. Think warm wood panels, analog knobs, glowing LED indicators, and cable connections, combined with clean typography and generous whitespace. The color palette should shift from calming blues/greens in Focus Mode to vibrant purples/oranges in Game Mode, with energy represented through glowing, pulsing elements that feel both retro and futuristic.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

**Rationale**: Single repository managing frontend, backend, shared libraries, and documentation optimizes for solo/agent-driven development. This approach simplifies dependency management, code sharing, and deployment coordination while supporting future modular separation as the product scales.

### Service Architecture: Modular Monolith with Progressive Scaling

**CRITICAL DECISION**: Deployed as a single application with well-defined internal modules (User Management, Productivity Engine, Game Logic, Analytics) rather than distributed microservices. This choice minimizes operational complexity for solo development while maintaining clear separation of concerns through modular architecture.

**Scaling Strategy**:
- **Phase 1 (0-5K users)**: Current monolith architecture
- **Phase 2 (5K-20K users)**: Separate game logic service before hitting 10K concurrent users
- **Phase 3 (20K+ users)**: Full microservice separation with event-driven architecture

### Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration + E2E

**CRITICAL DECISION**: Comprehensive testing approach essential for quality maintenance with limited QA resources:
- **Unit Tests**: 80%+ code coverage for business logic and component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints, database interactions, and cross-module functionality
- **Manual E2E Testing**: Critical user journey validation for core focus-to-game loop
- **Automated E2E**: Key workflows like onboarding, preset creation, and session persistence

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Technology Stack:**
- **React 18+ with TypeScript**: Chosen for type safety, component reusability, and AI agent code generation compatibility
- **State Management**: Zustand for complex application state with local component state for simple interactions
- **UI Framework**: Custom component library built on Tailwind CSS for unique synth aesthetic and design consistency
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for performant 30-45 FPS animations with optimized interaction feedback
