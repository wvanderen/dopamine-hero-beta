## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.2 (User Authentication System) has been completed with comprehensive implementation and testing, but environment setup issues are preventing smooth development on subsequent stories. The authentication system includes all required dependencies and test infrastructure, but some packages may not be properly installed or configured.

### Current Environment Issues Identified

Based on the codebase review, several environment setup issues need to be addressed:

#### Package Installation Issues
- **Missing Dependencies**: Some test dependencies may not be installed (Jest, Supertest, etc.)
- **Workspace Configuration**: npm workspace configuration needs verification
- **Lockfile Synchronization**: Package lockfiles may be out of sync across packages

#### Precommit Hook Issues
- **Husky Configuration**: Git hooks may not be properly installed or configured
- **Lint-staged Setup**: File staging and linting configuration may have issues
- **ESLint Rules**: ESLint configuration may have missing or conflicting rules

#### Test Infrastructure Issues
- **Jest Configuration**: Jest setup files and mocks may need verification
- **Test Compilation**: TypeScript test compilation may have configuration issues
- **Missing Test Files**: Some test files referenced in configuration may not exist

### Technology Stack Context

Based on the technology stack requirements [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:

#### Development Tools Configuration
- **Package Management**: npm + Workspaces (10.0+) for monorepo management
- **Testing**: Jest + Supertest (29.7+ / 6.3+) for backend testing
- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier configuration for code quality
- **Git Hooks**: Husky for precommit hook management
- **Build Tools**: Vite (5.0+) for frontend, TypeScript compilation for all packages

#### Monorepo Structure Requirements

The project follows the unified monorepo structure [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Unified Project Structure]:

```
dopamine-hero/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/          # React web application
│   └── api/          # Express API backend
├── packages/
│   ├── shared/       # Shared business logic
│   └── config/       # Shared configuration
└── root workspace configuration
```

### Environment Configuration Requirements

#### Required Environment Variables
Based on the authentication system implementation, the following environment variables should be configured:

```bash
# Firebase Configuration (for existing auth system)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=dopamine-hero-app
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@xxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----..."
FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://dopamine-hero-app.firebaseio.com

# JWT Configuration

```

#### Database Setup Requirements
- **PostgreSQL**: Local PostgreSQL instance for development
- **Redis**: Local Redis instance for session management
- **Database Migrations**: Migration scripts should be executable
- **Seed Data**: Basic seed data for development and testing

### File Locations and Project Structure

- **Shared Config**: `packages/shared/package.json`, `packages/config/`

#### Development Scripts
- **Root Scripts**: `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`
- **App-specific Scripts**: Development servers for web and API
- **Workspace Scripts**: Cross-package operations and builds

### Testing Infrastructure Requirements

Based on the testing strategy from the technology stack [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Testing Strategy]:

#### Test Configuration
- **Frontend Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library configuration
- **Backend Testing**: Jest + Supertest setup for API testing
- **Test Environment**: Proper test database configuration
- **Coverage Reporting**: Coverage collection and reporting configuration

#### Test Setup Requirements
- **Mock Configuration**: Proper mocking for external dependencies
- **Test Database**: Separate test database configuration
- **Fixture Data**: Test fixtures and seed data for consistent testing
- **CI Integration**: Test configuration for GitHub Actions

### Precommit Hook Requirements

#### Code Quality Checks
- **ESLint**: Linting for all TypeScript/JavaScript files
- **Prettier**: Code formatting verification and auto-fixing
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript compilation verification
- **Test Running**: Automated test execution on relevant files
- **Build Verification**: Ensure build processes complete successfully

#### Hook Configuration
- **Husky**: Git hooks management and installation
- **lint-staged**: Configuration for running checks on staged files only
- **File Patterns**: Proper file pattern matching for different check types

### Validation Requirements

#### Development Environment Verification
- **Package Installation**: All dependencies installed without errors
- **Development Servers**: Both web and API servers start successfully
- **Database Connections**: PostgreSQL and Redis connections working
- **Test Execution**: All tests pass in development environment
- **Build Processes**: All packages build successfully

#### Precommit Hook Validation
- **Hook Installation**: Git hooks properly installed in `.git/hooks/`
- **Configuration Files**: All configuration files properly formatted
- **Execution Time**: Hooks complete within reasonable time limits
- **Error Reporting**: Clear error messages for any failures

### Troubleshooting Guidelines

#### Common Issues and Solutions
- **Package Installation**: Clear npm cache, delete node_modules, reinstall
- **TypeScript Errors**: Verify tsconfig.json configurations across packages
- **Test Failures**: Check test environment setup and database connections
- **Linting Issues**: Verify ESLint configuration and rule consistency
- **Build Failures**: Check for missing dependencies or configuration errors

### Success Criteria

The story is complete when:
1. `npm install` completes successfully at repository root
2. `npm run lint` shows no errors or warnings
3. `npm run test` executes all tests successfully
4. `npm run build` completes for all packages without errors
5. `npm run dev` starts both web and API development servers
6. Git commits trigger precommit hooks that pass successfully
7. New developers can follow setup documentation and get running quickly
