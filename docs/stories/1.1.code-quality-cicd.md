## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.0 successfully established the monorepo structure, TypeScript configuration, Docker development environment, and basic documentation. However, it did not implement automated code quality enforcement or CI/CD pipeline, which are critical for maintaining development quality and reliability as the project scales.

### Code Quality Standards
Based on architecture documentation [Source: architecture-standards.md#Code Quality Standards]:

#### ESLint Configuration Requirements
- **TypeScript strict mode**: Prevent runtime errors and ensure type safety
- **Critical rules**: No explicit any, no non-null assertions, prefer-const, no-var
- **Naming conventions**: PascalCase for components/interfaces, camelCase for variables
- **Security rules**: No eval, no script URLs, unsafe member access warnings

#### Prettier Configuration
- **Print width**: 100 characters for readability
- **Tab width**: 2 spaces for consistency
- **Semicolons**: Required for statement termination
- **Quotes**: Single quotes with JSX double quotes
- **Trailing commas**: ES5+ for better diff tracking

#### TypeScript Strict Mode
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true
  }
}
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Requirements
Based on architecture documentation [Source: architecture-deployment-testing.md#CI/CD Pipeline]:

#### Pipeline Structure
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop branches, pull requests to main
- **Jobs**: Test quality checks → Build applications → Deploy to environment
- **Node.js version**: 18.x specified across all jobs
- **Caching**: npm dependencies for faster builds

#### Quality Check Jobs
- **Linting**: npm run lint across all packages
- **Type checking**: npm run type-check for TypeScript validation
- **Testing**: npm run test:coverage with 80% threshold
- **Coverage upload**: Integration with external service

#### Deployment Strategy
- **Frontend**: Vercel with production/staging environments
- **Backend**: AWS ECS with blue-green deployment
- **Environments**: Development (local), Staging (testing), Production (live)
- **Rollback**: Automated rollback on deployment failure

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture-tech-stack.md#Unified Project Structure]:

#### Root Configuration Files
- **ESLint**: `.eslintrc.js` (root) + package-specific overrides
- **Prettier**: `.prettierrc` (root) + `.prettierignore`
- **TypeScript**: `tsconfig.json` (root) + extended configs in packages
- **Git Hooks**: `.husky/` directory configuration
- **CI/CD**: `.github/workflows/` directory

#### Package Scripts Structure
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx,.js,.jsx",
    "lint:fix": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx,.js,.jsx --fix",
    "format": "prettier --write .",
    "format:check": "prettier --check .",
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
    "test": "jest",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
    "build": "npm run build --workspaces",
    "dev": "npm run dev --workspaces",
    "prepare": "husky install"
  }
}
```

### Testing Requirements
Based on testing strategy [Source: architecture-deployment-testing.md#Testing Strategy]:

#### Test Coverage Thresholds
- **Global coverage**: 80% minimum for branches, functions, lines, statements
- **Frontend**: Vitest + React Testing Library configuration
- **Backend**: Jest + Supertest for API testing
- **Coverage reporting**: Multiple formats (text, JSON, HTML)
- **Integration**: Coverage upload to external service for PR tracking

#### Test Organization
- **Unit tests**: `apps/*/tests/unit/` and `packages/*/tests/unit/`
- **Integration tests**: `apps/*/tests/integration/`
- **E2E tests**: `apps/web/tests/e2e/` (Playwright)
- **Setup files**: Individual test setup in each package

### Technical Constraints
From architecture documentation [Source: architecture-standards.md#Critical Fullstack Rules]:

#### Code Quality Enforcement
- **Type safety**: All code must pass TypeScript strict mode
- **Linting**: All code must pass ESLint rules without warnings
- **Formatting**: All code must be formatted with Prettier
- **Testing**: New features require corresponding tests
- **Documentation**: Complex business logic requires inline documentation

#### Performance Requirements
- **Build time**: CI builds should complete within 5 minutes
- **Test execution**: Full test suite under 3 minutes
- **Deployment time**: Deployments under 10 minutes
- **Quality gates**: PR checks should complete within 2 minutes

### Development Workflow Commands
From architecture documentation [Source: architecture.md#Development Workflow]:

#### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all development servers
npm run dev

# Run individual services
npm run dev:web
npm run dev:api

# Code quality checks
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm run test

# Code formatting
npm run format
npm run lint:fix
```

#### Pre-commit Workflow
- **Stage files**: Git add changed files
- **Lint check**: Automatic ESLint validation
- **Format check**: Automatic Prettier formatting
- **Type check**: TypeScript compilation validation
- **Test run**: Relevant test execution
- **Commit**: Only passes if all checks succeed

### Integration with Existing Infrastructure
Building on Story 1.0 accomplishments:

#### Docker Development Environment
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Must work within Docker containers
- **CI consistency**: Docker images should match CI environment
- **Volume mounts**: Proper configuration for node_modules caching
- **Environment variables**: Consistent across local and CI environments

#### Monorepo Structure
- **Workspace management**: Scripts must work across all packages
- **Dependency resolution**: Proper hoisting for ESLint/Prettier
- **Build ordering**: Correct package build dependencies
- **Path mapping**: Consistent import resolution across packages

### Security Considerations
From security documentation [Source: architecture-standards.md#Security Requirements]:

#### Code Quality Security Rules
- **XSS prevention**: ESLint rules to prevent XSS vulnerabilities
- **Dependency scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning in CI
- **Secret detection**: Prevent secrets from being committed
- **Input validation**: Enforce validation patterns in linting

#### Deployment Security
- **Environment secrets**: Proper secret management in GitHub Actions
- **Access control**: Restricted deployment permissions
- **Audit logging**: Deployment action logging and monitoring
