- Configuration files: Root level `package.json`, `.env.example`
- Applications: `apps/web/` and `apps/api/`
- Shared packages: `packages/shared/`, `packages/ui/`, `packages/config/`
- Documentation: `docs/` directory

### Testing Requirements
No testing requirements for this setup story - verification focuses on environment validation.

### Technical Constraints
- **Node.js version**: 18.0.0+ [Source: architecture-tech-stack.md#Prerequisites]
- **npm version**: 9.0.0+ [Source: architecture-tech-stack.md#Prerequisites]
- **Git version**: Required for version control
- **Docker version**: Required for local development containers [Source: architecture-tech-stack.md#Prerequisites]

### Development Workflow Commands
From architecture documentation [Source: architecture.md#Development Workflow]:

**Initial Setup Commands**:
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/dopamine-hero.git
cd dopamine-hero

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup environment
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env

# Start development
npm run dev
```

**Development Commands**:
```bash
# Start all services
npm run dev

# Start frontend only
npm run dev:web

# Start backend only
npm run dev:api

# Run tests
npm run test
npm run test:coverage
npm run lint
npm run type-check

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Project Structure Notes
The project uses npm workspaces monorepo structure [Source: architecture-tech-stack.md#Unified Project Structure]:
- Root package.json manages workspaces
- Separate packages for frontend, backend, and shared utilities
- TypeScript configuration with strict mode across all packages

### Environment Configuration
Based on architecture patterns [Source: architecture.md#Development Environment]:
- Environment templates provided at `.env.example`
- Separate configurations for web and API applications
- Development, staging, and production environment support

## Testing
Not applicable for this infrastructure setup story.

### Debug Log References
No debug logs created - story completed without blocking issues

### Completion Notes List
- Setup documentation already existed in comprehensive setup-guide.md file covering all story requirements
- Created missing project structure files referenced by setup guide to ensure consistency
- All acceptance criteria met through existing documentation plus created infrastructure files
- No blocking issues encountered during implementation
- Project structure now matches monorepo setup described in architecture documentation

### File List
**New Files Created:**
- package.json - Root monorepo configuration with workspaces
- docker-compose.yml - Database and Redis development containers
- apps/web/package.json - Frontend application package configuration
- apps/web/.env.example - Frontend environment template
- apps/api/package.json - Backend API package configuration
- apps/api/.env.example - Backend environment template
- packages/shared/package.json - Shared utilities package
- packages/ui/package.json - Shared UI components package
- packages/config/package.json - Configuration package
