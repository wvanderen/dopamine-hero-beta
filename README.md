## ✨ What is Dopamine Hero?

Dopamine Hero bridges the gap between effective productivity and genuine entertainment by converting focus sessions into customizable synth module acquisitions, allowing users to build personalized **"productivity soundscapes"** while accomplishing real-world goals.

### 🎯 The Core Innovation

Our revolutionary **Energy-Dopamine Economic Loop** replaces conventional gamification with a sophisticated dual-currency system that mirrors real brain chemistry:

- **Energy** (earned from focus sessions, spent on modules) represents your raw output capacity
- **Dopamine** (generated by optimized module configurations, enhances focus capabilities) represents your neurological reward system

This creates a **self-reinforcing loop** where productivity improvements directly unlock gameplay advantages, while strategic optimization of synth setups generates real-world focus benefits.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎮 Dual-Mode Architecture

**Focus Mode** - Clean, distraction-free environment:
- ⏱️ Focus timer with task management
- 💎 Energy accumulation based on completed sessions
- 🎯 Task categorization (Creative, Analytical, Physical, Learning)
- 📊 Real-time progress tracking

**Game Mode** - Engaging synth rack interface:
- 🎛️ Drag-and-drop module assembly system
- 🔗 Complex module interactions and synergy bonuses
- 🎵 Create personalized productivity "soundscapes"
- 💡 Strategic optimization for dopamine generation

### 🧠 Neurodivergent-First Design

Unlike tools that treat ADHD as an afterthought, Dopamine Hero's core mechanics specifically address executive function challenges:

- **Immediate Feedback Loop**: Visual and interactive rewards eliminate delayed gratification
- **Energy Color System**: Different task types generate colored Energy affecting module acquisition
- **Preset Management**: Save/load configurations for different work scenarios
- **Strategic Depth**: Complex module interactions provide engaging mental stimulation
